# postmastertips
A wow addon.
This wow addon makes it easier to complete the Postmaster Quest memory mini-game, which is extremely difficult. It displays a list of corresponding places under each continent. Written in LUA, uses wow addon api. No xml. TOC refers to the lua file and onload. Monitors for change_zone_indoors to fire, checks if it's postmaster. A similar eventmonitoring sees that it's not Postmaster afterwards and removes text as soon as you walk out.

Updated TOC for WoW 11.00.00
Version 1.0.1
